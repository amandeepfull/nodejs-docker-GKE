# Contact App

Its Contact application app, where we can store our contacts with few more information

In this project we learned :
1. create architecture for node app and database as Redis cache
2. Frontend is in react.js
3. Docker and Kubernetes

# Stack used:
1. Node.js
2. Redis
3. React.js
4. Redux.js
5. Docker
6. Kubernetes
7. Google Cloud 

Redis : we configure for only local host, if we want we can directly connect with remote host of redis server and make use.

if we are using google cloud platform and want to use redis we can use in following ways:
1. create a VM under compute engine.
2. Install redis on VM and using internal Ip of VM we can connect to redis server.

if we want to manage remote redis from our local we can link remote server with our local machine using external Ip of specific VM machine.
It will make the things easy for debugging and we can configure all things by our localhost.


# Docker terminal commands:
1.  docker run image

2.  docker ps 

3.  docker ps -all

4.  docker build .

5.  docker build -t <user-name>/<project-name>:1.0.0 // we can specify version as tag for image

6.  docker run -p osExternalPort:imagePortSpecified image 

7.  docker images

8.  docker start containerId

9.  docker start -i containerId

10. docker stop containerId

11. docker kill containerId

12. docker logs

13. docker exec -it containerId <image specific command>: we will just go inside the container and write image specific commands, for eg: Image is redis, docker run -it redis redis-cli. we will go right into redis cli to manage redis in container.

14. docker exec -it containerId sh:

15. docker build -f <Docker File Name> . :  building docker with different filename

# Docker Compose terminal commands
1. docker-compose build .

2. docker-compose up

3. docker-compose stop

4. docker-compose start

5. docker-compose kill

6. docker-compose logs

# Docker Volume
How to use in React App:
1. Run react app using docker-compose up
2. Open another terminal and enter command npm run watch

Now if we make any changes in app and reload the browser it can reflect in browser.


**Learning and building is in under process**
